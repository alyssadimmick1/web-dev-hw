  <h3>Mary Wells</h3>

<div class="text">
  <p>Mary Wells (1928-) has created some of the most iconic images and sentiments in the history of advertising. She began as a copywriter in the 1950’s at a department store in her hometown of Youngstown, Ohio, and jumped into agency life on Madison Avenue at Mccann Erickson in New York She took risks in work and life, and when it came to advertising, believed in the theatrical and the dramatic. She coined “plop, plop, fizz, fizz” for a certain antacid. Outfitting Braniff’s stewardesses in printed Pucci and commissioning artist Alexander Calder to paint their fleet of planes in pastels in the 1960’s was her head-turning “end of the plain plane” idea (it turned Braniff into the airline of the jet set). When she walked out of one agency and opened her own, Wells Rich Greene, in 1967, she became the first female CEO of a company on the New York stock exchange (and at one point the highest-paid executive in the industry. She helped save American Motors Corporation from bankruptcy with the first-ever automobile comparison ads – and by helping redesign its cars. She resurrected Manhattan’s image with “I love New York.” She’s lived and worked in NewYork, Dallas, London, The French Riviera, Mexico, and Brazil. With a bevy of audacious friends – Joni Evans, Lesley Stahl, Joan Juliet Buck, Candice Bergen, Lily Tomlin, Marlo Thomas, and Liz Smith included – she launched the website wowOwow (for “women on the web”) as a platform for conversation between them and women around the world. And in 2010, she helped launch the lifestyle site Purewow to elevate women’s everyday on national and local levels. “You have to read books on subjects you know nothing about,” she said about being successful. “You have to travel to places you never thought of traveling. You have to meet every kind of person and endlessly stretch what you know.” It’s good life advice too.
