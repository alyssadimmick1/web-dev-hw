Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?

My imaginary client is called "I run Missoula" and is a non-profit organization that holds marathons to raise money for charity.
They described their site needs as a simple easy to understand layout with a dropdown menu that leads to sites for each type of race they organize.

What is the difference between display: block, display: inline, and display: inline-block?

display: block; is used to turn ‘inline’ elements into block elements which is often used to create vertical navigation bars out of lists.
display: inline-block; removes new lines inherent in block elements and also forces elements to respect margin and vertical spacing properties/rules. You must explicitly set the width of these elements because they will expand horizontally to fill the parent-container.
display: inline; forces elements to act like inline elements which ignore width properties, do not force new lines, do not honor margin properties as they flow with other content on the screen, and can't change vertical distance between them and other elements.

Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

To begin this assignment I set up my assignment folder in Atom and added in the necessary files and folders required for this assignment. I then added the 4 main and meta document elements to my index file, and linked my style file to my index, contact and about files. After that, I followed along with the walkthrough video and adjusted elements as I needed to in order to fit the vision that I had. Once I was happy with my menu bar and styling in my index page, I completed my contact and about pages and linked them into the index file.
