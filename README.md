Alyssa Dimmick
I am 28 years old, the mom of a 7 year old daughter, and I am originally from the Oregon Coast. I love water, watching sports, working out, looking up interior design and high fashion campaigns online, and anything that brings out my creativity. I am graduating at the end of this semester with a BA in Organizational Communications and a CAS in Business Media Design.
