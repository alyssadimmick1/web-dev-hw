ids are used as a way to identify the element. Classes are also identifiers, but are used to identify similar types of elements. Divs provide a block element used to group other elements together. Span is an inline equivalent to div and is used to create extra styling.

Alt text stands for alternative text and is used by people who are visually impaired.
