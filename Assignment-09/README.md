Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?

The universal selector is used to style every element on a page.
The element selector is used to select all elements of a certain type. class selectors select elements that serve the same function. The ID selector allows developers to define style rules for a specific element by calling its unique ID.



Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes.

For my background colors I chose crimson	(#DC143C) black (#000000) and goldenrod	(#DAA520) and for my text I chose rosybrown	#BC8F8F. I chose these colors because I felt that they complimented the tones that are in the magazine cover images from the 1950's that I included on my webpage, and emulated the emerging boldness in femininity that truly came forward in the next decade.

Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
I began my project with finding inspiration for my page and gathering my images and color palettes that I found would be helpful. Next, I added in the necessary files and folders required for this assignment. I then added the 4 main and meta document elements to my index file, and linked my style file to my index file. Next I added my divs to my index file and assigned their colors and positions in my style file. Lastly, I added my text div and my images and experimented with their colors opacity and positioning until I was happy with the result.
