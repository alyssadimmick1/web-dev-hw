    <h1>When Great Trees Fall</h1>
      <h2>Maya Angelou</h2>
      <hr>
    <p>When great trees fall, <br>
rocks on distant hills shudder, <br>
lions hunker down <br>
in tall grasses,<br>
and even elephants<br>
lumber after safety.</p>

<p>When great trees fall <br>
in forests, <br>
small things recoil into silence, <br>
their senses <br>
eroded beyond fear.</p>

<p>When great souls die, <br>
the air around us becomes <br>
light, rare, sterile. <br>
We breathe, briefly. <br>
Our eyes, briefly, <br>
see with <br>
a hurtful clarity. <br>
Our memory, suddenly sharpened, <br>
examines, <br>
gnaws on kind words <br>
unsaid, <br>
promised walks <br>
never taken.</p>

<p>Great souls die and <br>
our reality, bound to <br>
them, takes leave of us. <br>
Our souls, <br>
dependent upon their <br>
nurture, <br>
now shrink, wizened. <br>
Our minds, formed <br>
and informed by their <br>
radiance, <br>
fall away. <br>
We are not so much maddened <br>
as reduced to the unutterable ignorance <br>
of dark, cold <br>
caves.</p>

<p>And when great souls die, <br>
after a period peace blooms, <br>
slowly and always <br>
irregularly. Spaces fill <br>
with a kind of <br>
soothing electric vibration. <br>
Our senses, restored, never <br>
to be the same, whisper to us. <br>
They existed. They existed. <br>
We can be. Be and be <br>
better. For they existed.</p>
