I've enjoyed learning HTML. I find all of it interesting because it is all new to me and I find it satisfying to see how code plays out into a webpage. The tables and forms were the most difficult for me to grasp in this module.

I am very excited to learn more about styling. I think styling is what makes a website easy or difficult to navigate and can make or break whether a website is deemed professional in the real world.
