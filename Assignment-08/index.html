    <h2>Step 1 - Line up your vehicle</h2>
      <p>- Use your right-hand turn signal<br>
        - Pull up next to the vehicle that will be parked in front of you allowing 3 feet of space between you <br>
        - Align your rear tires with the parked car's bumper <br>
        - Shift your vehicle into reverse and check for oncoming traffic

    <h2>Step 2 - Begin reversing at an angle</h2>
      <p>- Without letting your foot off the break, turn the wheel two full turns to the right<br>
        - Slowly ease your foot off of the break, use light gas if necessary, until the front end of the vehicle is facing away from the parked car at a 45 degree angle<br>
        -Stop the vehicle
      </p>

    <h2>Step 3 - Straighten the wheel and reverse again</h2>
      <p>- With your vehicle at a stop, straighten out your wheel
        - Slowly ease off the break again and reverse straight back until the front end of your vehicle has cleared the parked vehicle
        - Stop the vehicle
      </p>

      <p>- Turn your wheel two turns to the left
        - Slowly ease your foot off the brake to complete reversing into the parking space<br>
        - Center your vehicle between the cars in front and behind you
